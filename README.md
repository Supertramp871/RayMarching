# RayMarching
Its RayMarching project, with a bouncing ball in a swimming pool using the magic of ray marching! This project is built with WinForms and utilizes OpenTK 1.1 for rendering.
Features 
Shader Manipulation: Use hotkeys or winforms menu to tweak the shader fields written in GLSL. Experiment with different settings to see how they affect the ball's behavior and the pool's appearance.
Known Issues
There’s a huge bug that I’m aware of. Since this project uses OpenTK 1.1 and rendering is not done through OpenGL Control:)
